# Movie-Recommendation-System
This repository contains the code for a movie recommendation system built using the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithms.

## Overview
The movie recommendation system aims to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions with movies. It utilizes two main algorithms:

KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): This algorithm calculates the similarity between movies based on various features such as genre, actors, directors, and user ratings. It then recommends movies that are similar to the ones the user has liked in the past.

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation): LDA is a probabilistic model used for topic modeling. In the context of this recommendation system, it helps in identifying latent topics within the movies. By analyzing the topics associated with a user's preferred movies, it recommends other movies that belong to similar topics.
